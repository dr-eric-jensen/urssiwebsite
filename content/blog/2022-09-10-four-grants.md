For many of us who develop, maintain, and use research software, the issue of software sustainability or lack thereof
has been an issue near and dear to our hearts. After numerous efforts to address different aspects of this issue
over the past decade, we secured funding from the
[National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1743188) in 2017 to build US community around this area and architect
what an ideal institute might look like. After several workshops involving the wider research community
and several pilot activities, we formulated a [plan](https://plan.urssi.us/) for an institute.

We are now pleased to announce four new grants to officially launch the US Research Software Sustainability Institute (URSSI)
as a virtual distributed institute.  Three of these grants are from the
[Better Software for Science program](https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology/better-software-for-science)
of the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/). The first of these, led by Karthik Ram, is to support
the institute itself and fund a community manager role. The second grant led by Daniel S. Katz is to understand and research policies
that impact research software and the people engaged in it. The last of these, led by Kyle Niemeyer, is to coordinate
efforts around training researchers in modern software engineering practices. We also have a grant
from the NSF's Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) program, led by Nic Weber, to understand
past software effortsâ€™ fate and develop a taxonomy of successful sustainability models. 

Stay tuned!
