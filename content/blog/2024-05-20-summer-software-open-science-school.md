__Do you want your science, research, and software to be open and accessible? Do you use, develop, or contribute to software in your research? Do you have some basic skills but desire more?__

If this sounds like you, then you might be interested in the upcoming Summer School in Open Science and Research Software Engineering. 
This workshop complements previous summer and winter schools hosted by URSSI to develop research software engineering skills. 
This school will help students hone their open science skills in addition to building research software engineering skills.  
In July 2024, we will be hosting a five day workshop on open science and research software engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

This is aimed at early-career researchers, particularly graduate students and postdocs, who are familiar with basic skills such as interacting with the Unix shell, version control using Git, and Python programming, and would like to learn more about best practices for developing research software and leveraging their research software to practice open science.

## Target Audience

This workshop seeks candidates that want to make their research open, accessible, and reproducible by implementing open science best practices. Further

To get the most benefit from this workshop, we expect students to be familiar with the Unix shell, Python, and git, at the level taught at a Software Carpentry Workshop. 

## Format and topics

This five-day workshop will enable learners to hone their skills in developing sustainable research software and building their science 

*   Software design and modularity
*   Collaborative software development via Git+GitHub
*   Software testing in Python
*   Code review
*   Packaging and distributing Python software
*   Documentation
*   Software, Data, and Documentation Licensing
*   Reproducibility

The school will consist of lectures on these topics along with open hacking time to allow participants to practice the concepts covered in the lectures. To facilitate the hands-on experience, each participant will bring a project to work on throughout the course for applying these concepts.
