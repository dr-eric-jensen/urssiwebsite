# URSSI Welcomes Second Cohort of Early-Career Fellows

We are happy to announce a second cohort of the [US Research Software Sustainability Institute (URSSI) Early-Career Fellowship](https://urssi.us/blog/2025/07/02/call-for-proposals-urssi-early-career-fellows-round-2/). This cohort includes three projects and five fellows working on the follwoing: 

**Characterizing LLM-Generated Code in Scientific Software** - [Shahan Ali Memon](https://samemon.github.io/), [David Farr](https://davidthfarr.github.io/), and [Eva Maxfield Brown](https://evamaxfield.github.io/) will investigate the detection of AI assisted development in code repositories that are linked to scientific articles. Their project will evaluate existing methods used for detection (e.g. code stylometry), create a dataset of verified AI/non-AI assisted code, and assess how adoption changes code quality, documentation practices, and reproducibility.  

**Sustainable Practices in Napari's Plugin Ecosystem** - [Timothy Monko](https://www.neuroscience.umn.edu/people/timothy-monko) will modernize the [Napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) plugin development infrastructure, and develop processes and procedures to better coordinate developers contributing plugins. Tim's work will also help Napari modernize its plugin documentation and adopt Python standards. 

**Sustaining Public Health Research Infrastructure in County Health Rankings & Roadmaps** - [Hannah Olson-Williams](https://uwphi.pophealth.wisc.edu/staff/olson-williams-hannah/) is working on migrating CHR&R program code to a sustainable R package. Having lost funding for this project, Hannah is building upon exceptionally well documented data infrastructure to make this public health information accessible to a broad base of reseachers and practitioners around the USA. 

We're excited to bring these three projects into the URSSI early-career program, and continue working with highly-motivated scientists who take their software seriously. 

URSSI plans to issue one additional call for proposals to the fellowship program early in 2026. We are seeking projects focused on AI/ML integration in scientific software, software sustainability best practices, and software education research - but if you have a project that you think would be a good fit please be in touch.
