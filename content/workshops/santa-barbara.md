Our third workshop was the first of our topic focused community gatherings. Over two days in January 2019, 20 participants who are experts in various aspects of software citation and credit gathered in Santa Barbara to discuss how an institute can help researchers get credit for their software contributions and explore various other metrics that could help address the credit problem.  The meeting followed an unconference format and featurde lightning talks and discussions over two days.
