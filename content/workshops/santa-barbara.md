Our third workshop is also the first of our topic focused community gatherings. Over two days in January 2019, 20 participants who are experts in various aspects of software citation and credit will gather in Santa Barbara to discuss how an institute can help researchers get credit for their software contributions and explore various other metrics that could help address the credit problem.  The meeting will follow an unconference format and feature lightning talks and discussions over two days. 

Additional details including resources, participants and talks are on our <a href="https://github.com/si2-urssi/software-credit">GitHub repo</a>. We'll post a detailed report on our blog once the workshop is complete.
