### Second Research Software Sustainability Institute Workshop in Chicago, IL (October 23-24, 2018)

![smaller](https://i.imgur.com/XxItviv.jpg)

We are excited to announce the second workshop in the URSSI conceptualization which will take place October 23 and 24 at the [Illini Center in Chicago, IL](https://illinicenter.illinois.edu/). 
Similar to our [first workshop in Berkeley](http://urssi.us/workshops/berkeley/), the event will be mostly participant driven. In addition to a few keynotes and 
lightning talks, the agenda will mostly be open discussions around topics suggested by participants prior to and during the meeting. 

We've <a href="http://urssi.us/blog/2019/04/04/urssi-chicago-workshop-report/">summarized this workshop in a blog post.</a>

In this workshop, we want to:

- Help attendees meet each other and understand their goals
- Get answers for our survey and encourage further distribution of the survey
- Talk about ethnographic studies
- Present a set of topics that we think will be potential areas of work in a future institute
- Identify a subset of these, plus additional topics that are potentially important to the community, to discuss further
- Refine, merge, discard topics
- Document the workshopâ€™s results

We want to come out of this workshop with:

- An informed and enthused set of attendees (including a group photo)
- A list of candidate topics for an institute, some of which may be well-understood
- Thoughts on institute roles - what could an institute do to address the topics?
- Thoughts on institute organization - how could an institute be organized to do this?

We welcome participation from anyone interested in issues and challenges facing research software sustainability. Specific topics can be suggested in [GitHub](https://github.com/si2-urssi/chicago_workshop/issues).
