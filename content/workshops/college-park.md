Our fourth workshop was the second of URSSI's topic focused community gatherings. This workshop brought together a diverse group of experienced software funders, community managers, developers, researchers, and software users to share their experiences supporting and maintaining software incubator programs. 

The meeting featured lightning talks and discussions over two days. Our goal was to come away from the workshop with a clearer vision of how URSSI might either develop a new incubator program, or connect to and support existing incubators.   

Additional details including resources, participants and talks are available in our <a href="https://github.com/si2-urssi/software-incubator">GitHub repo</a>.
