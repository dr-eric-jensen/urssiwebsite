Our fourth workshop is the second of URSSI's topic focused community gatherings. This workshop will bring together a diverse group of experienced software funders, community managers, developers, researchers, and software users to share their experiences supporting and maintaining software incubator programs. 

The meeting will feature lightning talks and discussions over two days. We hope to come away from the workshop with a clearer vision of how URSSI might either develop a new incubator program, or connect to and support existing incubators.   

Additional details including resources, participants and talks will be available in our <a href="https://github.com/si2-urssi/software-incubator">GitHub repo</a>. We will also post a detailed report on our blog once the workshop is complete.
