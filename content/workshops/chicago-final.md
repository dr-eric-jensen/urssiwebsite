Our last workshop was a final meeting of the PIs, Senior Personnel, Advisory Committee members and a few guests. We met in Chicago 9-10 April 2019 to work through the outputs of the previous workshops, survey, and ethnographic studies, as well as inputs provided by the community through our <a href="https://discuss.urssi.us">discussion board</a>, with the goal of starting to write an institute plan, including a draft organization and budget.

Details of the workshop are <a href="https://github.com/si2-urssi/final_workshop">available on GitHub</a>.
