## Advancing research software policy

This website houses resources, publications and other outputs from the *“Charting the Course: Policy and Planning for Sustainable Research Software,”* a project funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. Our policy work aimed to grasp the nuances of the research software landscape and enact changes that lead to beneficial outcomes. This project ran from 2023-2025, and was dedicated to supporting the future of research software through evidence-informed policy work.
