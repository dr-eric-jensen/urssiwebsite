As part of a set of connected activities under the banner of the US Research Software Sustainability Institute, this grant funds an effort by Kyle Niemeyer, Associate Professor of mechanical engineering at Oregon State University, to develop and run four, weeklong “beyond introductory” winter/summer schools for researchers who want to deepen their software engineering skills.

Beyond directly training researchers in sustainable software development, Niemeyer will develop, hone, and release a scalable mid-level curriculum for the training of non-expert scientists in best practices in software engineering. His project will also provide useful data on the size of demand for such skills-training events.
