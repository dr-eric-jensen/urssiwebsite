The URSSI policy project asks “How can policy be used to increase the sustainability and impact of research software in the scholarly research community?” It has three objectives: 1) Influencing positive policy changes, 2) Understanding why such changes succeed and fail in this context, and 3) Planning for future policy work based on these lessons.

The project will rely on a postdoc, and is currently seeking the right person; see the [job posting](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/about/careers/#po)

The project tasks are to:

1. Assemble and maintain a list of potential policy activities (with elements of both policy research and policy advocacy)
2. Accomplish some of these policy activities
3. Document the lessons from these policy activities and use this to plan and propose an expanded and improved research policy center

The majority of the full project proposal is also [publicly available](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6819396).
